# 05b-Exercises-pygame-physics

Here are some exercises to help you learn about how 2D game physics might be implemented.

This assumes that you have Pygame installed.

There are three exercise files in this repository. Follow the instructions in each of them to fulfill the exercise. Then commit your changes to your repository and push them back to GitHub.

Some of the exercises require you to interpret what is going on. Feel free to explore other variations until you can come up with a reasonable explanation. 

As with your assignments, please edit the LICENSE file (replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name), and edit this file to describe what your code does.

The following may be helpful to get you started:

* [PyGame Drawing Basics](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs5nm/topics/pygame/drawing/)
* [pygame.sprite](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html)
* [pygame Tutorials: Sprite Module Introduction](https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/SpriteIntro.html)
* [Program Arcade Games with Python and Pygame: Introduction to Sprites](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=introduction_to_sprites)
* [Sprites with Sprite Sheets](http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/en/sprite_sheets/)
* [How to Create a Custom 2D Physics Engine](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-custom-2d-physics-engine-the-basics-and-impulse-resolution--gamedev-6331)
* You can find some [nice colors here](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) and their [RGB recipes here](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/ingredients.html)
* An open-source repository of graphics you can use in your projects is available at [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org)
